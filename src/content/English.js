about_desc: "Latur epitomizes the divine place for education. Our district has brought several revolutionary changes in education including the well-acknowledged ‘Latur Pattern’ that improved the quality of secondary education. Our district has continuously topped the annual results of secondary and higher secondary examinations. 108 out of 151 students who scored 100 out of 100 marks in the 2022 state board exam were from Latur. More than 2200 medical students passed through NEET every year from our district. It is also our district that gives the maximum number of engineering students through JEE. Students from all over the state come to Latur for education. Despite many crises like continuous drought and migration, the academic result graph of our district continues to climb every year due to the strength of meritorious students and education. Therefore, Latur district should get a 'Central University' so that the students here can get higher quality education at the local level.",
